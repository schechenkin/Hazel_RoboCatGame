# Hazel

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Hazel is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/schechenkin/Hazel_RoboCatGame.git`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
